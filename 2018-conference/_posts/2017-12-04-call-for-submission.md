The C++Now 2018 Call For Submissions is open. We invite all members of the C++ community, including first time submitters, to submit session proposals to the 7th annual C++Now Conference: C++Now 2018 (Aspen CO, USA, May 6 – 11, 2018).

C++Now builds upon the resounding success of previous BoostCon and C++Now conferences. We look forward to considering your proposals. You will be joining leading speakers from the entire C++ community in making C++Now 2018 better than ever.

<!--more-->

The C++Now Conference will focus on education about open source software usage and developments in the C++ developer and user community. To reflect the breadth of the C++ and Boost communities, the conference includes sessions aimed at three constituencies: C++ and Boost end-users, hard-core library and tool developers, and researchers pushing the boundaries of computing. The program fosters interaction and engagement within and across those groups, with an emphasis on discussion.

As a multi-paradigm language, C++ is a melting pot with the most compelling ideas from other programming communities blended in powerful ways. Historically, some of the most popular sessions at C++Now have highlighted these concepts, from DSLs to functional programming to transactional memory and more.  Bring your C#, Python, Ruby or Haskell influences to bear in an environment that will broaden their exposure.

Presentations at C++Now 2018 will generally focus on the now established C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards, the upcoming C++20 standard, and predictions of how those standards may shape the future of C++, but by no means is this intended to restrict the topics of proposals we hope to see. As described below, any other topic related to C++ is suitable for submission.

### Important Dates

| Proposal submissions due |   <strong>January 24</strong> |
| Proposal decisions sent | <strong>February 26</strong> |
| Program online | <strong>March 18</strong> |

<strong>Note</strong>: We strongly recommend that you make your submissions as early as possible. During submission evaluation, the Program Committee may have questions about your submission. If you submit early, these questions may be sent to you for clarification. If you submit close to the deadline, it is unlikely that there will be time to offer you the opportunity to provide answers or clarifications.

### Session Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following:

- C++11/14/17 and how it changes life for users and library writers 
- New directions and proposals for upcoming C++ standards 
- Concepts and generic programming 
- Designing for testability and testing best practices
- Using specific Boost libraries in depth 
- Extending or enhancing existing Boost libraries 
- Advanced implementation techniques used in Boost libraries 
- The design and/or development process 
- Software development tools and/or their application to C++ and/or Boost 
- Boost infrastructure topics such as build tools, website, testing 
- Tools for better developer productivity
- Use of modern C++ with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology
- Any other topics likely to be of great interest to C++ developers 

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is the style of learning and participation that has proven most successful at these events. Sessions can be tutorial, with an emphasis on interaction and participant involvement, or workshops, whether hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven collaborative work.

#### Tool vendors

We actively encourage tool vendors and ISP’s to submit proposals about products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries, tools, etc.). We discourge proposals about marketing, but are always interested in technology and its applications.

### Session Formats

- _Lectures_ focus on a practitioner’s ideas and experience with anything relevant to the C++ community.

- _Tutorials_ are sessions at which instructors teach conference participants specific skills or knowledge relevant to C++.

- _Workshops_ provide an active arena for advancements in C++-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest and experience.

- _Case Studies_ are reports on a particular project or projects that attempted something new and the results of the experience.

- _Panels_ feature three or four people presenting their ideas and experiences relating to C++’s relevant, controversial, emerging, or unresolved issues.  _Panels_ may be conducted in several ways, such as comparative, analytic, or historic and usually feature interaction between participants as well as Q&A with the audience.

- _Demonstrations_ show attendees what a particular process, product, technique, or library is capable of and how it is best used.

- Other formats may also be of interest. Don’t hold back a proposal just because it doesn’t fit into a pigeonhole.

### Submitting a Proposal
All submissions should be made through our <a href="/submission/">submission page: here</a>.

The conference schedule is based upon 90-minute sessions with breaks between. Shorter presentations will be grouped, when possible, to fill a 90 minute slot and longer presentations will be split across multiple sessions.

One registration fee is waived for a 90 minute presentation. Shorter sessions are prorated.

Submissions are considered for inclusion in the program by a peer review process.

Session materials will be shared with the C++ community on the C++Now website.

For any questions about the submission process, please contact the Program Committee <mailto:cppnow2018@easychair.org> .

Note: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive, perpetual license to publish  materials submitted to C++Now, either electronically or in print, in any media related to C++Now.
